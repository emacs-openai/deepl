# deepl
> Elisp library for the DeepL API

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-openai/deepl/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-openai/deepl/actions/workflows/test.yml)

The DeepL Elisp library provides convenient access to the DeepL API from
applications written in the Elips language. 

*P.S. This package is expected to be used as a library, so there are only a few
interactable commands you can use, and those are mostly examples.*

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

You will need to set up your API key before you can use this library.

```elisp
(setq deepl-key "[YOUR API KEY]")
```

Alternatively, you can configure a function to retrieve the key from some
external source. A function, `deepl-key-auth-source` is provided to retrieve
the key from an auth-source entry under the `:host` key `api.deepl.com`

```elisp
(setq deepl-key #deepl-key-auth-source)
```

For using another DEEPL endpoint, 

```elisp
(setq deepl-base-url "[DEEPL BASE URL]")
```

### ðŸ”° Example

Here is the simplest example that teaches you how to use this library. This is 
a function with a `text`, `target-lang` and a `callback` function.

```elisp
(deepl-translate "How are you?" "ZH"  ; translate to Chinese
                 (lambda (data)
                   (message "%s" data)))
```

## ðŸ›‘ Debugging

While playing through this library, you might see this error quite often.

```
400 - Bad request.  Please check error message and your parameters
```

Try setting the variable `deepl--show-log` to `t`, it will show more error
messages.
